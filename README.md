# URL-Opener
An incredibly small program to mass open URLs that a user specifies.

## How does it work?
Simply, create a text file called "urls" with a url on each line, in the directory of the program. The program will open every URL you put in that file.

If a browser window is already opened, they will all open as new tabs. If there isn't a browser window open, they'll all open as new windows.
